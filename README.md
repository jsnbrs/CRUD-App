# ga-project-2
Second project at GA

Database driven message board CRUD web app built on Sinatra using Ruby and SQL. 

Created secure sign up, login and password functionality with the database by utilizing [bcrypt](http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org) Ruby gem to store encrypted passwords. 

Also used [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) library for Markdown text formatting and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) boilerplate for CSS. Deployed the Rack based site to Heroku cloud application hosting platform.

The link to the site is https://jason-project.herokuapp.com, Heroku takes a few seconds to get its Dyno's spinning, so it might take a little bit of time to open.
